* Word Search Puzzle
Word Search Puzzle is a game to find out words in a matrix composed of
characters.  It is a GUI program and I don't think you need many
configurations to make it work (at least under Windows).

** Development Environment
The program was developed using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (yes it's
old like that).

** Binaries and Codes
There is a prebuilt version of the program in the =Production=
directory.  It was built for Windows XP under intel x86 architecture.
The source codes are put in the =Code= directory.
